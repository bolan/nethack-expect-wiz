nethack-expect-wiz
==================
This is a Nethack start scumming bot.


Features:
==================
1) It has three conditions, so you can get it fast: In:18, Magic Missile, and Ring of slow digestion. (You still can add more conditions, such as another ring)

2) It runs fast and stable. Every time your computer's random seed changes, it can run two to three times to scum. It means that, you will never miss any single random seed changing.
